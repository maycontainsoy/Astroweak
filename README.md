# Astroweak

Nuclear weak interaction stuff for astrophysics. All of this code has been written for a Windows user using OXBASH. neutrino_rates_cc.py and its associated functions have been modified to accomodate Bigstick (?) formatted overlap files. 

weaklib.py A library of functions for doing nuclear weak astrophysics computations. 

neutrino_rates_cc.py Computes charged current reaction rates and energy loss rates for a specified nucleus.
